# HBAdissertation
This repository includes code for the thesis entitled 'Utilising Policy Types to Achieve Effective Ad Hoc Coordination in the Game Othello'. It uses Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination to explore multi agent systems, in this case the board game Othello, that involve heterogeneous agents that do not know, a priori, how other agents in the system behave. Also included is a copy of the finished dissertation report.

## MATLAB
MATLAB was used for prototyping during the early stages of the project.

## PYTHON
Includes the Python code used for the experiments. The code that implements the Othello game was adapted from Salerno (2016).
